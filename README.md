# Token42 (TKN) - README

## Introduction
Token42 (TKN) is an ERC-20 token created on the Ethereum blockchain named "Tokenizer". This project is designed to teach the fundamentals of blockchain development and token creation while adhering to technical standards and ensuring secure deployment.

Token42 demonstrates basic functionality as an ERC-20 token, including transferring tokens between wallets and querying balances. The ticker symbol for the token is **TKN**, and it follows the ERC-20 standard, which is widely recognized and supported across the Ethereum ecosystem.

## Technical Choices
### Token Name and Ticker
The token is named **Token42**, as per the project requirement to include "42" in the name. The ticker symbol **TKN** was chosen for its simplicity and relevance to the project.

### Blockchain Platform
Ethereum was selected as the blockchain platform for this project due to its:
- Extensive support for smart contract development.
- Robust developer tools and resources.
- Widespread adoption and compatibility with wallets and exchanges.

### Programming Language and Tools
The smart contract was developed using Solidity, the primary language for writing Ethereum smart contracts. The following tools were utilized:
- **Remix IDE**: For writing, testing, and deploying the smart contract.
- **Hardhat**: To manage the local development environment and run tests.

I followed tutorials on **NodeGuardians** to gain proficiency with Solidity and the Ethereum blockchain (I greatly recommand the platform).

### Test Environment
The project was developed and tested on the **Sepolia testnet** to avoid the use of real funds. Sepolia provides a safe environment to deploy and interact with the token without financial risk.

## Repository Structure
The project repository is structured as follows:

```
.
├── README.md               # Project overview and details
├── code/                   # Smart contract source code
├── deployment/             # Deployment scripts and configurations
├── documentation/          # Detailed documentation and whitepaper
```

### `code/`
This folder contains the Solidity code for the Token42 smart contract. The code is well-documented with clear and explicit comments, ensuring readability and ease of understanding.

### `deployment/`
This folder includes deployment scripts and necessary configurations to deploy Token42 on the Sepolia testnet. Instructions for deploying the token are also included.

### `documentation/`
The documentation folder provides a comprehensive guide on:
- How Token42 works.
- Instructions to interact with the token.
- Security considerations and implementation details.
- The smart contract address and links to the token on blockchain explorers (e.g., Etherscan for Goerli).

## Features
Token42 complies with the ERC-20 standard and supports the following functionalities:
1. **Transfer**: Tokens can be transferred between accounts.
2. **Balance Queries**: Users can check their token balances.
3. **Approval and TransferFrom**: Allows delegated token transfers.
4. **Ownership and Security**: The contract includes basic ownership privileges to prevent unauthorized modifications.

## Deployment Details
- **Blockchain Network**: Ethereum (Sepolia Testnet)
- **Contract Address**: 0x000
- **Explorer Link**: www.google.fr

## Demonstration
Minimalistic actions demonstrating the operation of Token42 include:
- Deploying the token on the Sepolia testnet.
- Transferring tokens between two test accounts.
- Querying account balances using a blockchain explorer.

## How to Use Token42
1. Connect to the Sepolia testnet using a wallet like MetaMask.
2. Add the Token42 contract address to view your token balance.
3. Use a blockchain explorer or tools like Remix to interact with the contract.

## Documentation and Future Enhancements
Comprehensive documentation is included in the `documentation/` folder. This includes:
- A whitepaper outlining Token42’s purpose and features.
- Steps to deploy the token on other testnets or the Ethereum mainnet.
